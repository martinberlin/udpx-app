**udpx is a technology to transport data over WiFi to microcontrollers**

## Android App

This is my humble intent to build in the first version a very easy hybrid App using Cordova to send RGB pixels to ESP32 controllers.
We are using canvas to render video, pixels are readed, compressed and send as binary data to the ESP32.

The ESP32 controllers should be running our UDPX Firmware or alternatively [OctoWifi firmware](https://github.com/spectrenoir06/OctoWifi-LEDs-Controller)
